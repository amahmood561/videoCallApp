# videoCallApp
Here is an example of a simple video call app using WebRTC and Python on the server-side and React on the client-side:

Server-side (Python):
Client-side (React):

This is a very basic example, in a real world app you would need to add more functionality like handling errors, reconnections, user's media handling, and more.

It's worth noting that the above example uses the aiortc library for Python and the built-in RTCPeerConnection API for React, which provides a simple and convenient way to use WebRTC. There are also other libraries and frameworks available




Here are the general steps to build and run the example WebRTC app using Python and React:

Install the necessary dependencies:
For the server-side, you will need to install Python and the aiohttp and aiortc libraries. You can do this by running the command pip install aiohttp aiortc
For the client-side, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You will also need to have a React application set up.
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the command line.

Create a new file called server.py in the project directory and copy the server-side code from the example into it.

In the client side, navigate to the directory where your React application is located and create a new component file called VideoCall.js in the src folder. Then copy the client-side code from the example into it.

In the React application, import the VideoCall component in your index.js file and render it.

In the command line, navigate to the project directory and run the command python server.py to start the server.

In the client side, run the command npm start in the React application's directory to start the development server.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the application running.

It's worth noting that the code provided is a basic example, in a real world application you would have to handle many more edge cases, and test it to ensure that it works as expected under different network conditions and browser versions.

Additionally, for a production-ready WebRTC app, you will need to set up a signaling server and handle other concerns such as security and scalability.
